## Expectation/Pre-requisite

You should already have knowledge of:
*   Python fundamentals (identifier, data types, loops, functions, OOP).
*   Python intermediate (decorator, lambda, typing, generator, iterator).
*   If you are new to Python, consider completing a beginner and intermediate Python course first.
*   We assume that we are on Python 3.8+
*   Git (In case you want to clone this repo and run it locally).

## What can you expect?

1. Gain in-depth understanding of Functional Programming principles, including first-class and high-order functions, pure functions, and immutability.
2. Learn intermediate and advanced concepts such as closures, currying, monads, functors, and the intersection of Functional Programming and OOP.
3. Apply theoretical knowledge in practical exercises, translating complex concepts into applicable skills for real-world projects.
